 * If the component supports click-through, then this is the enabled
 * state of the (sub-)component.
 * <p>
 * If the component supports focus-request, then it is the enabled state of the
 * (sub-)component and the focused state of the window.
 * <p>
 * If the component does not support any of the above, then it is the enabled
 * state of the (sub-)component and the focused state of the component.
